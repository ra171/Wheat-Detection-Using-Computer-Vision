## Introduction
We use __wheat__ everyday in the form of __bread__, __oats__ and other important breakfast and lunch items. It would be really good if the manual process of detecting wheat and their __density__ is replaced by __machine learning__ and __data science__. Since there are many forms of wheat, we must be identifying the right kinds of wheat plants so that they could be processed quickly. This could be done with the __convolutional neural networks (CNNs)__ and it becomes a computer vision problem.

It is also important to accurately detect the wheat plants and sometimes the wind could blur the images. In addition to this, there could be factors such as __maturity__, __color__, __genotype__, and __head orientation__ that could make detecting and classifying wheat a challenging task. 

## Computer Vision

With the aid of __computer vision__, it is possible to count the total number of wheat heads present in an image. We do this by giving annotated examples of various images and the count of the wheat heads. As we are annotating those images, soon the computer vision model learns from the data and labels and predicts the density of wheat plants from an image. As a result, one could estimate the total density of wheat plants in a particular area. Furthermore, steps can be taken to improve the yield if their density is predicted to be low by the computer vision models and vice-versa.
